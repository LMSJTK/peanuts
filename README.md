# Peanuts and Crackerjacks

**Peanuts and Crackerjacks** is a baseball management and simulation game with a retro, sprite-based presentation and a strange secret hiding beneath the surface.

You manage a small regional baseball club in a shared league — setting lineups, managing your stadium, growing your fanbase, and watching full games play out pitch by pitch. What most fans don’t know is that the league’s owners are not entirely human, and the cheers of the crowd do more than just lift morale.

This project is intentionally designed to be:
- **Free to play**
- **Simulation-first**
- **Spectator-friendly**
- **Lore-rich, but subtle**

## 🎮 Core Gameplay

### Management
- Run a regional club that shares players, spectators, and resources with the league
- Set lineups, rotations, and strategic priorities
- Manage stadium economics:
  - Ticket prices
  - Concessions (yes, peanuts & crackerjacks)
  - Promotions, sponsorships, and marketing
- Develop your park over time, unlocking new advantages and abilities

### Simulation
- Every game is simulated **pitch by pitch**
- Outcomes are based on:
  - Pitcher stats
  - Batter stats
  - Defender stats
  - Situational context
  - Controlled randomness
- Full box scores and season-long stats are preserved
- You can:
  - Sim entire games
  - Watch games unfold live
  - Review detailed play-by-play logs

### Spectator Mode
- View games as a fan with:
  - Play-by-play text
  - Field visualization
  - Crowd reactions
- Stadium atmosphere and crowd energy matter

### Home Field Influence
- Each stadium has unique properties
- Large or energized crowds can temporarily alter reality:
  - Modifiers are applied *during simulation* without overwriting historical stats
  - Example: hitters performing better against a known starter at home
- Effects are subtle, situational, and designed to preserve realism

### Organ Player (Later Game)
- At higher progression levels, players may influence games indirectly
- The Organ is not cosmetic — it is infrastructure
- Timing, song choice, and momentum can amplify crowd effects

## 🧙 Lore (Intentionally Understated)

Baseball predates the modern era in this world.

Long ago, extradimensional beings known as **The Princes** ruled peacefully for centuries. When they were banished, remnants of their civilization remained — especially stadiums.

Some Princes stayed behind.
Some Demon Dudes stayed behind.

To avoid open conflict and human attention, they turned to baseball — a sport of ritual, spectacle, and rules — as a way to compete, observe one another, and pass the time until something bigger arrives.

Most players will never be told this outright.

They’ll just feel it.

## 🎨 Visual Style

- 2D sprite-based presentation
- SNES-inspired resolution and palettes
- Dark blue UI backgrounds
- White, blocky text
- Player info displayed as baseball cards
- Stadiums range from classic to supernatural

The player never controls athletes directly — baseball is observed, not played.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Initial)

- HTML5 Canvas
- Vanilla JavaScript (no engine required)
- Modular simulation logic
- Asset-light by design

This project intentionally avoids heavy frameworks early to keep iteration fast and transparent.

## 🚧 Project Status

Early development / prototyping  
Primary focus areas:
1. Core pitch-by-pitch simulation
2. Stadium & spectator systems
3. Simple sprite navigation & viewing modes
4. Data models for season persistence

## 📜 License

TBD (likely permissive / open-source friendly)
